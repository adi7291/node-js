##"this"
========
this keyword refer to object that called the function or this refers to a object that is currently executing the code.

const eventOne = {
  name:'Birthday Event',
  printEvent (){
    console.log(`w are celebrating ${this.name}`)

  }
}
eventOne.printEvent()

This refers to object(eventOne) which call the function or method(printEvent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const eventTwo = {
  name: "Anniversary Event",
  guestList: ["Anil", "Gulchi", "Vikash"],
  printGuestList() {
    console.log(`Guest list for ${this.name}`); // ✓ this = eventTwo
    
    this.guestList.forEach(function (guest) {
      // ❌ this = undefined (in strict mode) or window/global (in non-strict)
      console.log(`${guest} is attending ${this.name}`);
      // this.name = undefined
    });
  }
};

eventTwo.printGuestList();
// forEach calls its callback function as regular function not as method of eventTwo

When regular function is called without an object Context, this 
a> undefined (in strict mode)
b> window global (in non-strict mode)

##Two Fix this problem we can use arrow function. Arrow function doesn't have
their own this. They inherit this from the parent scope
