In Node.js, every file is wrapped in its own private function, so variables stay in local (module) scope.
Every .js file we create in Node.js is automatically wrapped like this.

(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  
  // Your entire file code is here

})();

var a = 10;

It is actually:

(function(){
  var a = 10;   // Local to this function!
})();

In browser 
var x=40; creates global variable accessible in window.x
but in  NODE.js var x=100 will be accessible only in that file until we export it.Node js protecting code from global pollution.
NOTE
-----
## Everything in Node.js is local because each file is wrapped in a private function (module wrapper) by default.
