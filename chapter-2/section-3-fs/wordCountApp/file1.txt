JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to create interactive and dynamic web applications. It runs in the browser as well as on servers through environments like Node.js. JavaScript follows a single-threaded, non-blocking model powered by the event loop, which allows it to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently. Core concepts include variables, functions, objects, closures, promises, and async/await. JavaScript supports multiple paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. With modern ES6+ features like modules, arrow functions, and classes, JavaScript has become a powerful, versatile language for frontend, backend, and full-stack development.
