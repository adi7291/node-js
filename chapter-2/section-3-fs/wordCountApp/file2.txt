Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, mainly on the server side. It is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing it to handle multiple requests concurrently without creating a new thread for each request. This makes Node.js highly scalable and suitable for real-time applications such as chat apps, streaming services, and APIs.

In Node.js, asynchronous operations are handled using callbacks, promises, and async/await, which help keep the application responsive. Node provides a rich set of built-in modules like fs for file system operations, http for creating servers, and path for working with file paths. Package management in Node.js is handled by npm (Node Package Manager), which allows developers to install, share, and manage third-party libraries easily. Tools like npx enable running packages without global installation.

Node.js supports both CommonJS and ES Module systems, giving flexibility in how code is organized. Overall, Node.js is widely used for building fast, scalable, and efficient backend applications using JavaScript.
