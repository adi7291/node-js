## Streams in Node js

- A Stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.
- Instead of loading entire file or large dataset into memory at once, streams process data in small chunks.
- while reading or writing streams of data it use Ram memory. If size of the file is big(2GB>) it uses most of the RAM memory for reading and writing file.
